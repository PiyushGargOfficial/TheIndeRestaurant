#Version 6

This is the version 6 of the food website which includes the landing page (home page ),about page,menu page,services page,blog page and now the contact page and reservation icon as well.
This makes all the links of the navbar active taking you to an individual custom page.

This project is done as for now.

//Somethings working:-
1.Scroll to top 
2.Gsap animations
3.All navbar links takes to individual custom pages.	

//Somethings missing :-
1.Not responsive.
2. Links to individual recipes are not coded yet.

//This is a static website and the layout and images are inspired from a theme but the code is done all by me solely.
